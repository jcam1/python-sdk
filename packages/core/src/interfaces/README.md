This directory contains the interfaces of the SDK.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Implementation

Please modify interface classes (expressed as [Python's abstract classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)) before modifying implementation classes. Comments should be written in [the Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
